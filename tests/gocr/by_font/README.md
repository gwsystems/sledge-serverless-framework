# OCR varied by font

Generates pnm image files containing random words from the wamerican dictionary.

The number of words is held constant at 100, but a different font is used to render the text. Generally, `mono` performs the best, followed by `URW Gothic`, followed by `Lobster Two`, which is a stylistic font that performs quite poorly. 

Run `install.sh` to install required tools and `run.sh` to run the tests.
