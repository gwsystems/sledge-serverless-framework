# Debugging Flags

# Enables logs of WASI syscalls
# CFLAGS += -DLOG_WASI

# Sandbox writes to stdout and stderr are both written to the client socket
# However, when set, stderr is also written to the host stderr to assist with debugging
# CFLAGS += -DLOG_SANDBOX_STDERR

# Strips out calls to assert() and disables debuglog
# CFLAGS += -DNDEBUG

# Redirects debuglogs to /runtime/bin/sledge.log

# This adds an array of sandbox states to all sandbox structs and appends states at each transition
# The history trucates when the number of elements equal SANDBOX_STATE_HISTORY_CAPACITY 
# CFLAGS += -DLOG_STATE_CHANGES

# This dumps per module *.csv files containing the cycle a sandbox has been in RUNNING when each
# page is allocated. This helps understand the relationship to memory allocation and execution time.
# CFLAGS += -DLOG_SANDBOX_MEMORY_PROFILE

# This flag dumps totals of incoming requests and outgoing responses, broken out by status code
# family, such as 2XX, 4XX, 5XX. It is useful to debug clients hanging waiting for a response.
# To log, run `call http_total_log()` while in GDB
# CFLAGS += -DLOG_TOTAL_REQS_RESPS

# This flag tracks the total number of sandboxes in the various states
# It is useful to debug if sandboxes are "getting caught" in a particular state
# CFLAGS += -DSANDBOX_STATE_TOTALS

# This flag enables an per-worker atomic count of sandbox's local runqueue count in thread local storage
# Useful to debug if sandboxes are "getting caught" or "leaking" while in a local runqueue
# CFLAGS += -DLOG_LOCAL_RUNQUEUE

# System Configuration Flags

# Sets a flag equal to the processor architecture
CFLAGS += -D${ARCH}

# Preprocessor

# SLEdge serverless functions are *.so shared-libraries. The runtime thus requires the dynamic linker
# to load these functions at runtime. These *.so shared-libraries also depend on specific symbols from 
# the runtime to execute. The export-dynamic Linker flag adds all globals to the dynamic symbol table, 
# allowing the libraries acess to such symbols. The libm math library is used several places, including
# in backing functions that implement the WebAssembly instruction set.
